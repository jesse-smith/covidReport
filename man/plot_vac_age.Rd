\description{
\code{plot_vac_age()} plots vaccinations by age group in a bar chart. It can
produce 4 distinct figures, depending on the values of \code{pct} and \code{by_pop}.
}
\details{
When \code{by_pop = TRUE},
the resulting figure displays vaccinations with reference to the population
of each age group; when \code{by_pop = FALSE}, the figure does not display
population-related values.

When \code{pct = TRUE}, values are displayed as percentages; when \code{pct = FALSE},
raw totals are displayed instead.

The combination \verb{pct = FALSE, by_pop = TRUE} results in the most informative
(but most complex) display. It shows vaccination counts as a fraction of
population totals. Any of the other 3 charts can be build from the
information in this one; however, this also means that the "take-home
message" from this figure is more open-ended than the rest.
